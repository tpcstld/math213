\section*{Question 1}

Find the general solution for the following differential equations. Hint: Some roots are complex. You may want to use factor theorem. \\

\noindent
a) $y'''' - 8y'' + 72y' - 65y = 0$ \\
b) $y^{(6)} - 4y^{(5)} + 6y^{(4)} - 8y^{(3)} + 9y'' - 4y' + 4 = 0$

\section*{Question 2}

Find the general solution of the following differential equation using the method of undetermined coefficients.

$$y'' - 8y' + 15y = x + \cos 2x$$
